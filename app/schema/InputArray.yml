# app/schema/InputArray.yml

# This schema validates that `InputArray` input field is an array, and it is required.
# We also show that elements are only validated via `InputArray.*` (per Valitron's usage notes)
#
# UF's transformations do not recognize `InputArray.*` as a match for any fields.
# HOWEVER, it matches `InputArray` against the entire array of fields--unlike Valitron!
#
# With the default test values, the InputArray validators will NOT trigger any error messages,
# but the InputArray.* validator WILL trigger.
#
# Additionally, this form has CSRF fields--they are not listed here,
# so Fortress's transformer whitelisting properly strips them.

InputArray:
  validators:
    required:
      message: "Warehouse Inventory array is required"
    array:
      message: "Warehouse must be an input array"
  #these will transform the entire array
  transformations:
  - purge
  - trim

InputArray.*:
  #this error will show on the final page, unless all submitted values are integers
  validators:
    integer:
      message: "Input elements must be integers."
  #these won't transform anything
  transformations:
  #- purge
  - trim
